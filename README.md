* OS Algorithm Simulation

.) Project Overview

The OS Algorithm Simulation project is designed to provide a visual and interactive representation of various operating system algorithms. The main objective is to help students and professionals understand the inner workings of these algorithms through a user-friendly interface.

* Features

1. CPU Scheduling Algorithms: Implements FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, and SRTF.
2. Memory Management Algorithms: Includes Paging and Segmentation.
3. Graphical Visualization: Provides animated representations of algorithm execution.
4. User Input Support: Allows users to enter custom data sets for simulation.
5. Real-time Logs: Displays step-by-step execution logs for better understanding.

* Technologies Used:

.) Frontend: React.js
.) Programming Language: JavaScript

* Usage Instructions

1. Select an algorithm from the menu.
2. Enter the necessary parameters (e.g., process IDs, burst times, priorities).
3. Click "Simulate" to visualize the execution.
4. View execution logs and step-by-step results.
5. Modify parameters and re-run simulations to compare results.
